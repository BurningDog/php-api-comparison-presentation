## To view

This is online at https://burningdog.github.io/php-api-comparison-presentation/index.html

## To control the presentation

You'll need the secret token value generated by the glitch.me app. Then, locally, run:

```sh
node node_modules/reveal-multiplexnode
```

and open http://localhost:1948/

As you change slides, these will change for any viewer.

This integration by using the the Reveal Multiplex plugin at https://github.com/reveal/multiplex

### Nice-to-haves

It would be nice to put the socket.io tokens into environment variables, as well as `APP=client` by default (or `presenter`). That means using `dotenv` and then moving the `Reveal.initialize()` out of `index.html` and into a js file which is then built, with either `client.js` or `master.js` being included depending on the env var values.
